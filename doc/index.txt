It consists of the following main modules:

  servers. If you don't know where to start, this is likely to be what you're
  looking for.

* ``couchdb.schema``: This module provides advanced mapping between CouchDB
  JSON documents and Python objects.

* ``couchdb.view``: This implements a CouchDB view server that allows writing
  view functions in Python
